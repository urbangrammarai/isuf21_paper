Urban morphology tends to consider form only when trying to understand urban
environment, leaving aside its functional aspects from population and amenities to green
and blue spaces. However, one can argue that only combination of form and function can
provide deeper insights into the complexity of cities. The notion of \textit{spatial
signatures} combines both aspects into a single model, defined as:

\newtheorem*{theorem}{}
\begin{theorem}
    A characterisation of space based on form and function designed to understand urban
environments
\end{theorem}

Spatial signatures then provide a typology of space defined by both form and function
together, encoding the interplay between the two. On the other hand, not all questions
can be answered using both components at the same time. Each of them, form as well as
function, can be studied independently when needed. This paper explores form component
of spatial signatures characterisation and derives form-based signatures as a
single-aspect classification of space.

% - spatial unit -- spatial unit criteria -- issues with available units -- proposal of
%   enclosed tessellation -- brief description and a reference to conceptual?
Spatial signatures are conceptually defined as an aggregation of granular elements into
contiguous areas based on the homogeneity of their characterisation. That poses a first
methodological question - which spatial unit should be used for capturing of such
characterisation? The optimal unit should be \textit{indivisible} - when split into
smaller components, none of them would be enough to encode character of a signature;
\textit{internally consistent} - each observation should reflect single signature type;
and geographically \textit{exhaustive} - every location in the area of interest, both
built-up and un-built, should be covered.

Literature tends to be split into three groups when it comes to unit of analysis. One
uses predefined administrative boundaries (REF) but that can be seen as a suboptimal
solution as their definition follows different goals and some even argue that
“administrative units obscure morphologic reality” \citep{taubenbock2019new}. The other
employs uniform grids, in some cases linked to a spatial index (like hexagonal H3 grid
\citep{brodsky2018h3}) or to other types of data commonly distributed on grids (e.g.
\cite{jochem2020}). However, grids cells are rarely indivisible and often internally
inconsistent as their definition does not reflect the spatial configuration on the
ground. The most common approach in urban morphology is to use structural elements as
buildings \citep{hamaina2012a}, street segments \citep{araldi2019} or plots
\citep{berghauserpont2019a} as a unit. However, these are not exhaustive as they are not
present in un-built areas. Plots would theoretically provide geographical exhaustiveness
but since their conceptual definition is not stable and geometric representation varies
\citep{kropf2018plots}, they are unfit for a large scale analysis.

We propose to use an alternative spatial unit named \textit{enclosed tessellation cell}
(EC), defined as:

\begin{theorem}
    The portion of space that results from growing a morphological tesselation within an
enclosure delineated by a series of natural or built barriers identified from the
literature on urban form, function and perception.
\end{theorem}

\martin{We should somehow cite the conceputal paper when we talk about signatures and EC}

The ECs are generated in three steps. First, a defined set of spatial features, that
divide space into smaller parts, is integrated into a single set of boundaries. Such
boundaries are usually formed by linear features as street network, railway or rivers.
Second, these boundaries are used to subdivide space into \textit{enclosures}, a smaller
areas delimited from all sides by at least one boundary feature. Third, enclosures are
combined with building footprints taking the role of anchors in space and subdivided
into ECs based on proximity to each building, using a morphological tesselation
algorithm \citep{fleischmann2020morphological}.

\martin{Figure?}

Resulting ECs are indivisible and internally consistent, as they are very granular and
linked at maximum to a single building, and exhaustive as they cover entirety of space
thanks to contiguous geometry of enclosures. Their structure and scale adapts to the
environment and can take a form of a small-scale granular mesh in city centres of
historical origin as well as large-scale polygons encoding the vast natural open spaces.

% - spatial signatures
% -- SS as a characterisation of space based on F and F - very brief intro
% -- components can be studies independently
% -- this paper focuses on form component only

% - spatial unit
% -- spatial unit criteria
% -- issues with available units
% -- proposal of enclosed tessellation
% -- brief description and a reference to conceptual?

% - data
% -- input data in general
% -- input data in the GB
% -- OS Open Map
% --- potential limitation of open data
% -- OS Open Roads

% - morphometrics
% -- characterisation of building patterns using morphometrics
% -- the principle of inclusiveness (more better) to minimise selection bias
% - context
% -- representation of context as topological distance
% -- reflection of distribution of characters

% - clustering & dissolution
% -- K-Means clustering of ET cells based on morphometric profile
% -- hierarchical approach - sub-dividing interesting clusters via second level K-Means
% -- aggregation of cells into form-based signatures

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

% - signatures in the context of morphological studies
% -- conceptual similarity with morphological region, urban tissue and similar
% -- differences between the concepts and resulting complimentarity
    % different scales, different purposes, different questions

% - scalability of morphological studies
% -- we can ask questions about larger patterns that we did before
% -- we can look into cross-national similarities and tendencies

% - reproducibility of morphological studies
% -- morphometric methods can be algorithmised, hence easily replicable and reproducible

% - limits
% -- in the context of morphometrics
% --- suboptimal data input (individual buildings)
% --- national extent and hence resolution of clustering - local differences may be smoothed out as insignificant from the national perspective
% -- in the context of morphology
% --- interpretability of classes
% --- precision of boundary placement
